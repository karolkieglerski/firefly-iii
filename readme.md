### Purpose
Personal financial management is pretty difficult, and everybody has their own approach to it. Some people make budgets, other people limit their cashflow by throwing away their credit cards, 
others try to increase their current cashflow. There are tons of ways to save and earn money. Firefly III works on the principle that if you know where you're money is going, you can stop it from going there.

By keeping track of your expenses and your income you can budget accordingly and save money. Stop living from paycheck to paycheck but give yourself the financial wiggle room you need.

### Features
Most importantly...

* Firefly can import any CSV file, so migrating from other systems is easy.
* Firefly runs on your own server, so you are fully in control of your data. It will not contact other sites or servers.
* If you feel youâ€™re missing something you can just ask me and Iâ€™ll add it!

But actually, it features:

* A double-entry bookkeeping system;
* You can store, edit and remove withdrawals, deposits and transfers. This allows you full financial management;
* You can manage different types of accounts;
  * Asset accounts
  * Shared asset accounts (household accounts)
  * Saving accounts
  * Credit cards
* Itâ€™s possible to create, change and manage money using budgets;
* Organize transactions using categories;
* Save towards a goal using piggy banks;
* Predict and anticipate bills;
* View income / expense reports;
* Rule based transaction handling with the ability to create your own rules.
* The ability to export data so you can move to another system.
* The ability to import data so you can move from another system.
* Organize expenses using tags;
* 2 factor authentication for extra security ðŸ”’;
* Supports any currency you want, including crypto currencies such as Bitcoin â‚¿.
* Lots of help text in case you donâ€™t get it.

## The end game
Firefly III should give you **insight** into and **control** over your finances. Money should be useful, not scary. You should be able to *see* where it is going, to *feel* your expenses and to... wow, I'm going overboard with this aren't I?

But you get the idea: this is your money. These are your expenses. Stop them from controlling you. I built this tool because I started to dislike it. Having it, not having, paying bills, etc. But no more. I want to feel "safe", whatever my balance is. And I hoop this tool can help. I know it helps me.
