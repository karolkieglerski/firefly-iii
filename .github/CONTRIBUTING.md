# Welcome to Firefly III on Github!

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute something to Firefly III!

## Feature requests

I am always interested in expanding Firefly III's many features. If you are requesting a new feature, please check out the list of [often requested features](https://firefly-iii.github.io/requested-features/).

## Bugs

First of all: thank you for reporting a bug instead of ditching the tool altogether. If you find a bug, please take the time and see if the [demo site](https://firefly-iii.nder.be/) is also suffering from this bug. Include as many log files and details as you think are necessary. Bugs have a lot of priority! 

## Installation problems

Please take the time to read the [installation guide FAQ](https://firefly-iii.github.io/installation-guide-faq/) and make sure you search through closed issues for the problems other people have had. Your problem may be among them! If not, open an issue and I will help where I can.

## Pull requests

When contributing to Firefly III, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method. I can only accept pull requests against the `develop` branch, never the `master` branch.

## Translations :us: :fr: :de:

If you see a spelling error, grammatical error or a weird translation in your language, please join [our CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/firefly-iii) project. There, you can submit your translations and fixes. The GitHub repository will download these automatically and they will be included in the next release.
