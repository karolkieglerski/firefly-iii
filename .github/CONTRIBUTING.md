## Hi there!

Thank you for taking the time to report an issue or requesting a new feature.

Please take note that there are NO rules or regulations when you submit an issue.

However, remember that you are probably not the first one to ask a question. Especially when the installation is concerned.

So take the time to read the [installation guide FAQ](https://firefly-iii.github.io/installation-guide-faq/) and make sure you search through closed issues for the problems other people have had. Your issue may be among them!
